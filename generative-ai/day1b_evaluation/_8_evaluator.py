# instruction following (did it follow the prompt?)
# groundedness (did it include relevant data?)
# fluency (how easy was the text to read?)
# others - verbosity, quality, safety, coherence

# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by AI models.
We will provide you with the user input and an AI-generated responses.
You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing summarization quality, which measures the overall ability to summarize text. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a summarization task and the context to be summarized are provided in the user prompt. The response should be shorter than the text in the context. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context.

## Criteria
Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the summarization task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.
Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context. The response does not reference any outside information.
Conciseness: The response summarizes the relevant details in the original text without a significant loss in key information without being too verbose or terse.
Fluency: The response is well-organized and easy to read.

## Rating Rubric
5: (Very good). The summary follows instructions, is grounded, is concise, and fluent.
4: (Good). The summary follows instructions, is grounded, concise, and fluent.
3: (Ok). The summary mostly follows instructions, is grounded, but is not very concise and is not fluent.
2: (Bad). The summary is grounded, but does not follow the instructions.
1: (Very bad). The summary is not grounded.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Assess the response in aspects of instruction following, groundedness, conciseness, and verbosity according to the criteria.
STEP 2: Score based on the rubric.
