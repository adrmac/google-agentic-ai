### Pairwise evaluation
# The pointwise prompt had 5 levels of grading, this might be too coarse for a system. Or you might want to improve a prompt that is 'very good.'
# Another approach -- compare two outputs, and rank your prompts.

# Implements pairwise QA quality prompt https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/metrics-templates#pairwise_question_answering_quality

# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B). You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.

You will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
You will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).

## Criteria
Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.
Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.
Completeness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.
Fluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.

## Rating Rubric
"A": Response A answers the given question as per the criteria better than response B.
"SAME": Response A and B answers the given question equally well as per the criteria.
"B": Response B answers the given question as per the criteria better than response A.

## Evaluation Steps
STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response A fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.
STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response B fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.
STEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.
STEP 4: Output your preference of "A", "SAME" or "B" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.
STEP 5: Output your assessment reasoning in the explanation field.
